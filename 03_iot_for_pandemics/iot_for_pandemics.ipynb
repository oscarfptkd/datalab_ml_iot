    "### WHY\n",
    "\n",
    "SARS-CoV-2 virus is very contagious, due to the combined effect of a long incubation period, a large fraction of infected people only developing mild symptoms yet still being contagious and a high survivability in surfaces and air droplets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncontrolled transmission in the population can cause rapid growth with an associated large mortality within risk groups and easily overwhelm the health systems. Strong confinement and social distancing  seem the only effective way to stop the rapid spread if it is already out of control.\n",
    "\n",
    "While country-wide confinement is required in the short-term to stop the current transmission waves, it might not be sustainable long-term from a social and economical perspective (vaccine production at scale it is probably years away and treatments are likely to be of help but not a definite solution).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without confinement even with massive testing it is really hard to track the virus transmission chain at scale, i.e. to find out who is likely to be infected by someone that has just tested positive. Better ways to trace transmissions between the population\n",
    "allow more directed testing campaign and containment by small group confinements.**\n",

   },
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "### HOW\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern technology is likely to help with the problem of tracking the transmission chain. We need a way to register potential virus transmissions between people so it could be used to trace the graph of possible infections once someone has tested positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be done with a powerful surveillance infrastructure, which is lacking in most countries and building it at the required scale is not possible or desired. Alternatively, the solution could be build based on people knowingly carrying personal devices, either voluntarily or enforced in public space until the crisis is controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large fractions of the world population already own a internet-capable sensor-rich smartphone, and additional smartphone-like devices could be also provided at scale for those that do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A transmission trace system at national or multi-national scale can be based on location (e.g. cell phone tower triangulation or A-GPS logs), close distance between peers (e.g. ultrasound or Bluetooth) or a combination of all these technologies. Data already collected by companies could also be reused. A secure and escalable data collection and analysis infrastructure could be build rapidly in the cloud and managed by a trusted parties**\n"

    "### WHAT\n",
    "\n",
    "A contact tracing system based on data collection by smartphones and other personal devices could be build in a short amount of time and could potentially address the problem of tracing the transmission chains, which in turn can be use to direct testing campaigns and enforce small group confinement, keeping most of the societal and economical activity intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "While promising, there are also unexplored concern regarding data protection and privacy, the different capabilities of the technologies mentioned, whether it could be enforced or a voluntary usage would suffice and how to put together the organisational, human and economical resources for creating an effective solution in a short time.\n",
    "\n",
