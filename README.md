## Notebooks

The tutorial is broken in five parts, each contained within a folder and based on
a single Jupyter Notebook. The notebooks have been prepared to allow their
execution in Google Colaboratory or a similar notebook service,
click on each link below to open them.

Here there is a list and a short description of each part of the tutorial:

0. `00_introduction/introduction.ipynb`: includes a very short presentation of the
  tutorial instructor, as well as the objectives, scope limitations and program
  overview of the tutorial.

1. `01_predictive_mainteinance/predictive_maintenance.ipynb`: predict when an turbofan
  plane engine will break based on reading of the integrated sensors so costly maintenance
  tasks can be scheduled smartly.

2. `02_trip_duration_prediction/trip_duration_prediction.ipynb`:  based real-world Taxi
  data from New York city in 2016, predict the duration of a taxi trip based on the
  pickup/drop-off coordinates, taxi information and additional datasets.

3. `03_internet_of_wands/internet_of_wands.ipynb` (WIP): using a smartphone as a magic wand,
  collect data of labelled magic spells and then train a spell recognition model
  based on our own sensor data.

4. `04_camera_object_recognition/camera_object_recognition.ipynb` (WIP): using a pre-trained state-of-the-art
   object detection system to identify and count the various objects in traffic camera footage.
